# Project-Based Learning (PBL) Project: Industrial Safety Monitoring System

This README.md file provides an overview of the Project-Based Learning (PBL) project focused on industrial safety monitoring.

## Project Description

The project presents an integrated system aimed at enhancing industrial safety through real-time object detection and monitoring. It consists of three main components:

### 1. Mobile Application

The mobile application serves as an intuitive interface for safety surveillance. Users can access real-time monitoring data and receive alerts regarding safety compliance.

### 2. Firebase Integration

Google's Firebase platform is utilized for streamlined data management. Firebase Firestore ensures efficient data storage and real-time updates of detection results, enhancing the system's reliability and effectiveness.

### 3. Computer Vision

The computer vision component employs the YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection. It checks leg positions and the presence of specific body parts to ensure safety compliance by monitoring individuals' positions and protective gear usage in real time. Additionally, the exploration of Vision Transformers, specifically DETR, provides insights into advanced techniques for object detection accuracy.

## Conclusion

This PBL project presents a comprehensive system that integrates a mobile application, Firebase, and computer vision for industrial safety monitoring. Each component contributes to the system's effectiveness in ensuring safety compliance in industrial settings.
