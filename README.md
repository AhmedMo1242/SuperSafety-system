# Integrated System for Industrial Safety Monitoring

This repository contains the implementation and research work conducted as part of two college subjects: Seminar and Problem-Based Learning (PBL).

## Seminar
In the Seminar subject, we conducted research focused on industrial safety monitoring through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with a mobile application. The seminar folder contains:

- **Codes:** The codes used during the research phase.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the repository contents.
- **Reports:** Research reports detailing our findings, methods, and results.

## PBL
In the PBL subject, we implemented the system proposed during the Seminar phase. The PBL folder contains:

- **Mobile Application:** Implementation of the mobile application for safety surveillance.
- **AI Code:** Implementation of the AI component using the YOLOv8 model and other algorithms for real-time object detection and monitoring.
